# usage and examples

### basic logic gates

`AND` (`&`) gate: `a & b`  
`OR` (`|`) gate: `a | b`  
`XOR` (`#`) gate: `a # b`  

### negation

negations are done with the `~` character, so `~(a & b)` would be a `NAND` gate.

`NOT` gate: `~a`

`NAND` gate: `~(a & b)`  
`NOR` gate: `~(a | b)`  
`XNOR` gate: `~(a # b)`
